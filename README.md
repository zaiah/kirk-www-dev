<h1>Pagan</h2>

A Lua HTTP framework.

<h2>Summary</h2>

It attempts to stay compact and loose, while still managing to be quickly able to
be turned into whatever it is you would like it to become.

This framework was written mostly as an exercise in learning more about HTTP. Along the way, it's evolved to actually become useful and get some real work done.

This package comprises all of the modules needed to run an instance of Pagan on the web.   It is not 100% necessary to have Pagan's CLI interface installed to get this module running, but it would prove helpful to install a copy of it on your system.

<h2>Inspiration</h2>

Without these guys making big waves in open source and allowing their code to be viewed and understood by all, I would not have been able to craft such a concept as Pagan in the time alloted.
